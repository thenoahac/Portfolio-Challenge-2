# <Portfolio-Challenge-2>

## Description

This was a challenge in where we were to use what we learned in class to build a portfolio landing page utilizing HTML and CSS.

-The motivation for this project was to push myself to better understand HTML and CSS and how they work together in building a page.

-I built this project as a way to push myself in areas where I was uncomfortable in order to get a hands on experience to strenghten my understanding of HTML and CSS and how they work hand in hand.

-This project helped solve my lack of understanding on best practices for CSS and utilizing its tools like flexbox, although I still have a long way to go to being comfortable with it, I still feel like I am at a better understanding than where I was even 2 days ago.

-I learned how to better use flex box and CSS in unison with HTML to create a portfolio landing page.
